Data Storage: Structured data is stored in a local Microsoft SQL Server database.

Future Plans: Build a machine learning model using Python or R to:

Recommend deals based on user purchase history or preferences

Track price trends

Predict future sales

Planned:

R / Python (scikit-learn or caret): Machine learning for deal recommendation

Flask / Shiny / Streamlit: Web app interface (future)
